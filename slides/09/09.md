# Unsupervised Word Embeddings

The embeddings can be trained for each task separately.

~~~

However, a method of precomputing word embeddings have been proposed, based on
_distributional hypothesis_:

**Words that are used in the same contexts tend to have similar meanings**.

The distributional hypothesis is usually attributed to Firth (1957):
> _You shall know a word by a company it keeps._

# Word2Vec

![w=70%,h=center](word2vec.pdf)

Mikolov et al. (2013) proposed two very simple architectures for precomputing
word embeddings, together with a C multi-threaded implementation `word2vec`.

# Word2Vec – SkipGram Model

![w=55%,h=center,mh=70%](word2vec.pdf)

Considering input word $w_i$ and output $w_o$, the Skip-gram model defines
$$p(w_o | w_i) ≝ \frac{e^{⇉W_{w_o}^\top ⇉V_{w_i}}}{∑_w e^{⇉W_w^\top ⇉V_{w_i}}}.$$

---
# Word2Vec – Hierarchical Softmax

Instead of a large softmax, we construct a binary tree over the words, with
a sigmoid classifier for each node.

If word $w$ corresponds to a path $n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_L$, we define
$$p_\textrm{HS}(w | w_i) ≝ ∏_{j=1}^{L-1} σ(\textrm{[+1 if }n_{j+1}\textrm{  is right child else -1]} \cdot ⇉W_{n_j}^\top ⇉V_{w_i}).$$

---
# Word2Vec – Negative Sampling

Instead of a large softmax, we could train individual sigmoids for all words.

We could also only sample the _negative examples_ instead of training all of
them.

This gives rise to the following _negative sampling_ objective:
$$l_\textrm{NEG}(w_o, w_i) ≝ \log σ(⇉W_{w_o}^\top ⇉V_{w_i}) + ∑_{j=1}^k 𝔼_{w_j ∼ P(w)} \log \big(1 - σ(⇉W_{w_j}^\top ⇉V_{w_i})\big).$$

~~~

For $P(w)$, both uniform and unigram distribution $U(w)$ work, but
$$U(w)^{3/4}$$
outperforms them significantly (this fact has been reported in several papers by
different authors).

# Character N-grams

Another simple idea appeared simultaneously in three nearly simultaneous
publications as [Charagram](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02789), [Subword Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04606) or [SubGram](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-45510-5_21).

A word embedding is a sum of the word embedding plus embeddings of its character
_n_-grams. Such embedding can be pretrained using same algorithms as `word2vec`.

~~~
The implementation can be
- dictionary based: only some number of frequent character _n_-grams is kept;
~~~
- hash-based: character _n_-grams are hashed into $K$ buckets
  (usually $K ∼ 10^6$ is used).

## Training

![w=50%,f=right](../07/sequence_prediction_training.pdf)

The so-called _teacher forcing_ is used during training – the gold outputs are
used as inputs during training.

~~~
## Inference

![w=50%,f=right](../07/sequence_prediction_inference.pdf)

During inference, the network processes its own predictions.

Usually, the generated logits are processed by an $\argmax$, the chosen word
embedded and used as next input.

# Attention

![w=35%,f=right](attention.pdf)

As another input during decoding, we add _context vector_ $c_i$:
$$→s_i = f(→s_{i-1}, →y_{i-1}, →c_i).$$

~~~
We compute the context vector as a weighted combination of source sentence
encoded outputs:
$$→c_i = ∑_j α_{ij} →h_j$$

~~~
The weights $α_{ij}$ are softmax of $e_{ij}$ over $j$,
$$→α_i = \softmax(→e_i),$$
with $e_{ij}$ being
$$e_{ij} = →v^\top \tanh(⇉V→h_j + ⇉W→s_{i-1} + →b) .$$

section: SubWords
# Subword Units

Translate _subword units_ instead of words. The subword units can be generated
in several ways, the most commonly used are:

~~~
- **BPE**:
  Using the _byte pair encoding_ algorithm. Start with individual characters plus
  a special end-of-word symbol $⋅$. Then, merge the most occurring symbol pair
  $A, B$ by a new symbol $AB$, with the symbol pair never crossing word boundary
  (so that the end-of-word symbol cannot be inside a subword).

~~~
  Considering a dictionary with words _low, lowest, newer, wider_, a possible
  sequence of merges:

  $$\begin{aligned}
    r \,\,\, ⋅ & → r⋅ \\
    l \,\,\, o & → lo \\
    lo \,\,\, w & → low \\
    e \,\,\, r⋅ & → er⋅ \\
  \end{aligned}$$

---
# Subword Units

- **Wordpieces**:
  Given a text divided into subwords, we can compute unigram probability of
  every subword, and then get the likelihood of the text under a unigram language
  model by multiplying the probabilities of the subwords in the text.

~~~
  When we have only a text and a subword dictionary, we divide the text in
  a greedy fashion, iteratively choosing the longest existing subword.

~~~
  When constructing the subwords, we again start with individual characters, and
  then repeatedly join such a pair of subwords, which increases the unigram
  language model likelihood the most.

~~~
Both approaches give very similar results; a biggest difference is that during
the inference:
- for BPE, the sequence of merges must be performed in the same order as during
  the construction of the BPE;
~~~
- for Wordpieces, it is enough to find longest matches from the subword
  dictionary.

~~~
Usually quite little subword units are used (32k-64k), often generated on the
union of the two vocabularies (the so-called _joint BPE_ or _shared
wordpieces_).

# Multilingual and Unsupervised Translation

Many attempts at multilingual translation.

- Individual encoders and decoders, shared attention.

- Shared encoders and decoders.

~~~
Surprisingly, even unsupervised translation is attempted lately.
By unsupervised we understand settings where we have access to large
monolingual corpora, but no parallel data.

~~~
In 2019, the best unsupervised systems were on par with the best 2014 supervised
systems.

section: Transformer
# Attention is All You Need

For some sequence processing tasks, _sequential_ processing of its elements
might be too restricting. Instead, we may want to combine sequence elements
independently on their distance.

# Attention is All You Need

The attention module for a queries $⇉Q$, keys $⇉K$ and values $⇉V$ is defined as:

$$\textrm{Attention}(⇉Q, ⇉K, ⇉V) = \softmax\left(\frac{⇉Q ⇉K^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)⇉V.$$

The queries, keys and values are computed from current word representations $⇉W$
using a linear transformation as
$$\begin{aligned}
  ⇉Q &= ⇉V_Q ⋅ ⇉W \\
  ⇉K &= ⇉V_K ⋅ ⇉W \\
  ⇉V &= ⇉V_V ⋅ ⇉W \\
\end{aligned}$$

---
# Attention is All You Need

Multihead attention is used in practice. Instead of using one huge attention, we
split queries, keys and values to several groups (similar to how ResNeXt works),
compute the attention in each of the groups separately, and then concatenate the
results.

# Attention is All You Need

## Feed Forward Networks

The self-attention is complemented with FFN layers, which is a fully connected
ReLU layer with four times as many hidden units as inputs, followed by another
fully connected layer without activation.

![w=50%,h=center](../07/layer_norm_residual.pdf)

# Attention is All You Need

## Positional Embeddings

We need to encode positional information (which was implicit in RNNs).

~~~
- Learned embeddings for every position.

~~~
- Sinusoids of different frequencies:
  $$\begin{aligned}
    \textrm{PE}_{(\textit{pos}, 2i)} & = \sin\left(\textit{pos} / 10000^{2i/d}\right) \\
    \textrm{PE}_{(\textit{pos}, 2i + 1)} & = \cos\left(\textit{pos} / 10000^{2i/d}\right)
  \end{aligned}$$

  This choice of functions should allow the model to attend to relative
  positions, since for any fixed $k$, $\textrm{PE}_{\textit{pos} + k}$ is
  a linear function of $\textrm{PE}_\textit{pos}$.

values closer to 1 and darker colors representing values closer to -1.

## Regularization

The network is regularized by:
- dropout of input embeddings,
~~~
- dropout of each sub-layer, just before before it is added to the residual
  connection (and then normalized),
~~~
- label smoothing.

~~~
Default dropout rate and also label smoothing weight is 0.1.

~~~
## Parallel Execution
Training can be performed in parallel because of the _masked attention_ – the
softmax weights of the self-attention are zeroed out not to allow attending
words later in the sequence.

~~~
However, inference is still sequential.

## Training

Adam optimizer (with $β_2=0.98$, smaller than the default value of $0.999$)
is used during training, with the learning rate decreasing proportionally to
inverse square root of the step number. Furthermore, during the first
$\textit{warmup\_steps}$ updates, the learning rate is increased linearly from
zero to its target value.

$$\textit{learning\_rate} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{d_\textrm{model}}} \min\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\textit{step\_num}}}, \frac{\textit{step\_num}}{\textit{warmup\_steps}} ⋅ \frac{1}{\sqrt{\textit{warmup\_steps}}}\right).$$

~~~
In the original paper, 4000 warmup steps were proposed.
