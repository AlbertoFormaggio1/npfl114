# Attention is All You Need

The attention module is defined as:

$$\textrm{Attention}(⇉Q, ⇉K, ⇉V) = \softmax\left(\frac{⇉Q ⇉K^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)⇉V.$$

~~~
Multihead attention is used in practice.

# Attention is All You Need

## Positional Embeddings

We need to encode positional information (which was implicit in RNNs).

~~~
- Learned embeddings for every position.

~~~
- Sinusoids of different frequencies:
  $$\begin{aligned}
    \textrm{PE}_{(\textit{pos}, 2i)} & = \sin\left(\textit{pos} / 10000^{2i/d}\right) \\
    \textrm{PE}_{(\textit{pos}, 2i + 1)} & = \cos\left(\textit{pos} / 10000^{2i/d}\right)
  \end{aligned}$$

  This choice of functions should allow the model to attend to relative
  positions, since for any fixed $k$, $\textrm{PE}_{\textit{pos} + k}$ is
  a linear function of $\textrm{PE}_\textit{pos}$.
