This assignment is an extension of `tagger_crf`, where we will perform the CRF
loss computation (but not CRF decoding) manually.

The [tagger_crf_manual.py](https://github.com/ufal/npfl114/tree/master/labs/08/tagger_crf_manual.py)
template is nearly identical to `tagger_crf`, the only difference is the
`crf_loss` method, where you should manually implement the CRF loss.
