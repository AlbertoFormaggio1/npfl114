### Assignment: tagger_cle
#### Date: Deadline: Apr 11, 7:59 a.m.
#### Points: 3 points

This assignment is a continuation of `tagger_we`. Using the
[tagger_cle.py](https://github.com/ufal/npfl114/tree/master/labs/07/tagger_cle.py)
template, implement character-level word embedding computation using
a bidirectional character-level GRU.

Once submitted to ReCodEx, you should experiment with the effect of CLEs
compared to a plain `tagger_we`, and the influence of their dimensionality. Note
that `tagger_cle` has by default smaller word embeddings so that the size
of word representation (64 + 32 + 32) is the same as in the `tagger_we` assignment.
