The tasks are evaluated automatically using the [ReCodEx Code
Examiner](https://recodex.mff.cuni.cz/). The evaluation is
performed using Python 3.6, TensorFlow 1.13.0, NumPy 1.16.0
and OpenAI Gym 0.10.11.

You can install TensorFlow 1.13.0 either to user packages using
`pip3 install --user tensorflow==1.13.0`, or create a virtual
environment using `python3 -m venv VENV_DIR` and then installing
TensorFlow inside it by running `VENV_DIR/bin/pip3 install tensorflow==1.13.0`.

### Teamwork

Working in teams of size 2 (or at most 3) is encouraged. All members of the team
must submit in ReCodEx individually, but can have exactly the same
sources/models/results. **However, each such solution must explicitly list all
members of the team to allow plagiarism detection using
[this template](https://github.com/ufal/npfl114/tree/master/labs/team_description.py).**
