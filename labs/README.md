The tasks are evaluated automatically using the
[ReCodEx Code Examiner](https://recodex.mff.cuni.cz/).

The evaluation is performed using Python 3.8, TensorFlow 2.4.1, TensorFlow
Addons 0.12.1, TensorFlow Probability 0.12.1, TensorFlow Hub 0.11.0 and OpenAI
Gym 0.18.0. You should
[install the exact version of these packages yourselves](#faq_install).

### Teamwork

Solving assignments in teams of size 2 or 3 is encouraged, but **everyone has to
participate** (it is forbidden not to work on an assignment and then submit
a solution created by other team members). All members of the team
**must** submit in ReCodEx **individually**, but can have exactly the same
sources/models/results. **Each such solution must explicitly list all
members of the team to allow plagiarism detection using
[this template](https://github.com/ufal/npfl114/tree/master/labs/team_description.py).**
